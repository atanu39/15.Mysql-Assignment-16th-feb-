    "A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized for easy retrieval, manipulation, and management. It can be thought of as a digital filing system that allows users to store and access data in a variety of formats, including text, images, videos, and more.

    "SQL databases are relational databases that are based on a structured data model. They use tables to store data and rely on a predefined schema to ensure that data is organized in a consistent way. SQL databases are typically used in applications that require complex transactions, such as banking, financial services, and e-commerce. SQL databases use a query language called SQL to retrieve and manipulate data.\n",

    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use a predefined schema. Instead, they use a flexible data model that allows data to be stored in a variety of formats, including key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-oriented, and more. NoSQL databases are typically used in applications that require high scalability, such as social media, gaming, and online advertising. NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, including JSON, MongoDB, Cassandra, and more.\n",
